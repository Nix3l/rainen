# game

## basic idea

- start game
- player is sitting at his place sharpening weapon
- suddenly loud thunder heard in distance
- go inspect
- find slightly roughened up looking man
- lost memories, can only remember the cause for an impending armageddon
- as game progresses, everything he says starts coming through
- man dies (?)
- as player keeps playing, they cant stop the armageddon from happening
- eventually game loops back on itself, and protagonist is the man (!)

essentially, the game is a time loop. im thinking it should loop around 4 times,
where each time the player is allowed to choose a certain "path".
each path should be about 1-2 hours (if i want to ever ship this that is)

the idea being that after each loop, the player learns some information and gp mechanics.
these mechanics can then let us open up new areas in older paths, or maybe even unlock new dialog options/actions.

the main goal of the player would be to find what is causing the impending doom/big event,
and ultimately figure out how to stop it from ever happening.

gameplay should mostly consist of platforming and occasional boss fights.
details to be ironed out later.
